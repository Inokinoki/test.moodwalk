### Description:
In this exercise, we are going to ask you to develop a web app using a third party api which is github. (https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/)
##### Key features:
- Implement an signin/signup page. (In Ruby on Rails, we use the Devise gem:
https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)
- For logged users, implement a search input for a github username (for instance
“octocat”), which returns a list of the user’s repositories.
The search result should first display the user’s avatar.
Then, it should display the user’s repositories sorted by watchers.
For each repository, display “name”, “description”, “watcher count”.

##### [Bonus - Optional]
- The logged user can star/unstar a repository.
- The logged user can see all previously starred repositories.
- Nice UI/UX (Twitter bootstrap ? https://getbootstrap.com/).
- Add tests (Rspec, cucumber).
- 
##### Technologies to use:
- Ruby on Rails (Preferable but Optional).
- ReactJS (Optional).
- Database of your choice.
